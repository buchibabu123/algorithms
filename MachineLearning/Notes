in Regression we are tryimg to predict output from given data set (Predict exact value Ex: predict the exact price of a house)
in classafication we are trying to classify which group the given input belongs from the given data set (classify the out put in to a category ex: the house value will be in particular range or not)


--->   Overfitting :   Addition of more independent variables to Multi regression reslults worst predection
--->   MultiCollinearity : Addtion of more independent variables  which has potentially related to each other make predection worst
--->   Ideal Solutions : indepedent variables corelated to dependenty variable
