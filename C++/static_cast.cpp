#1 ) performs implicit conversion between types float to int ,int to float , pointer conversion 
#2 ) checks pointer conversion and returns error if conversion is not valid  ( int *ptr =static_cast<int*>(&c); )
#3 ) static cast avoid cast from derived to private base pointer
#4 )  static cast should be prefered when converting to void* or from void* 
 */

/*

1.) for compatable type conversion like int to float ..
2.) to avoid unrelated pointer conversion
3.) finding is easy
4.) to check code at compilation time for errors
