==========================  UP CASTING   ======================
Converting a derived-class reference or pointer to a base-class reference or pointer is called upcasting. It is always allowed for public inheritance without the need for an explicit type cast.

Actually this rule is part of expressing the is-a relationship. A Derived object is a Base object in that it inherits all the data members and member functions of a Base object. Thus, anything that we can do to a Base object, we can do to a Derived class object.

==========================  DOWN CASTING   ======================
The downcasting, the opposite of upcasting, is a process converting a base-class pointer or reference to a derived-class pointer or reference.

It is not allowed without an explicit type cast. That's because a derived class could add new data members, and the class member functions that used these data members wouldn't apply to the base class.
