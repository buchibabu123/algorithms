Run Time Type Identification ( RTTI ) allows progams that uses pointers or references to base classes to retrieve the actual derived types of the objects to which these pointers or references refer

RTTI is provided through two operators:

1)  The typeid operator, which returns the actual type of the object referred to by a pointer (or a reference).
2)  The dynamic_cast operator, which safely converts from a pointer (or reference) to a base type to a pointer (or reference) to a derived type.
