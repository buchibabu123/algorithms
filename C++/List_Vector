vector:

Contiguous memory.
Pre-allocates space for future elements, so extra space required beyond what's necessary for the elements themselves.
Each element only requires the space for the element type itself (no extra pointers).
Can re-allocate memory for the entire vector any time that you add an element.
Insertions at the end are constant, amortized time, but insertions elsewhere are a costly O(n).
Erasures at the end of the vector are constant time, but for the rest it's O(n).
You can randomly access its elements.
Iterators are invalidated if you add or remove elements to or from the vector.
You can easily get at the underlying array if you need an array of the elements.
list:

Non-contiguous memory.
No pre-allocated memory. The memory overhead for the list itself is constant.
Each element requires extra space for the node which holds the element, including pointers to the next and previous elements in the list.
Never has to re-allocate memory for the whole list just because you add an element.
Insertions and erasures are cheap no matter where in the list they occur.
It's cheap to combine lists with splicing.
You cannot randomly access elements, so getting at a particular element in the list can be expensive.
Iterators remain valid even when you add or remove elements from the list.
If you need an array of the elements, you'll have to create a new one and add them all to it, since there is no underlying array.









As std::list do not provide random access, there many STL algorithms that uses Random Access Iterators can not be used with List. Hence std::list provides some extra functions for Sorting, Splicing, Removing elements and identifying unique elements.

Vector provides the random access and hence can be used with STL algorithms that uses Random Access Iterators.
