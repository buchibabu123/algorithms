---> Nth from Last
---> detect loop in a linked list and find the length of the loop
---> checking a list is palindrome or not
---> remove duplicates in a sorted and unsorted array
---> swaps nodes without swaping data
---> pairwise swap elements  of a linked list
---> intersection of 2 linked lists
---> segregate even and odd nodes in a linked list
---> check if a linked list is circular or not
---> finding Intersection point of 2 lists
	find the lenght of 2 linked lists L1,L2 ,take the difference D = L1-L2 from the head of biggest list traverse D nodes now onwords both the     lists has same  number of nodes , iterate the nodes from both the lists untill we find thematch nodes
