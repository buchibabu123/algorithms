->static variables are stored in data segment 

Static variables should not be declared inside structure. The reason is C compiler requires the entire structure elements to be placed together (i.e.) memory allocation for structure members should be contiguous. It is possible to declare structure inside the function (stack segment) or allocate memory dynamically(heap segment) or it can be even global (BSS or data segment). Whatever might be the case, all structure members should reside in the same memory segment because the value for the structure element is fetched by counting the offset of the element from the beginning address of the structure. Separating out one member alone to data segment defeats the purpose of static variable and it is possible to have an entire structure as static.
